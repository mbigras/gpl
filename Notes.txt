Notes

Differences between Go and Ruby


Compiled instead of interpreted language
Statically typed instead of dynamically typed
User defined Types instead of Classes, there is no inheritance
For loop is the only loop statement

Questions

machine code vs byte code
statement vs expression
quadratic process, looping through args, but what about strings.Join?

- Look up documtation for fmt.Printf for %g from the command line

go help doc
usage: go doc [-u] [-c] [package|[package.]symbol[.methodOrField]]
go doc fmt.Printf
func Printf(format string, a ...interface{}) (n int, err error)
    Printf formats according to a format specifier and writes to standard
    output. It returns the number of bytes written and any write error
    encountered.
go doc fmt | grep '  %g'
    %g	%e for large exponents, %f otherwise. Precision is discussed below.
